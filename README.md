## Overview

**Board** is a collaborative whiteboard web application, inspired by Miro, that allows users to create, edit, and interact with boards in real time. Built using Next.js with TypeScript for the frontend, this project integrates a range of technologies to support real-time collaboration, user authentication, and state management. It utilizes Clerk for user authentication, Convex for a real-time database, Liveblocks for live presence and collaborative interactions, Shadcn UI for an elegant design system, and Zustand for global state management.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: User sign-up and login using Clerk.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple users can interact on the same board simultaneously, powered by Liveblocks and Convex.
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Easily add and manipulate elements on the board.
- **State Management**: Global state management using Zustand.
- **Customizable Boards**: Create, update, and delete boards, with support for real-time updates.
- **Responsive UI**: Fully responsive design using Shadcn UI.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:**

  - Next.js (with TypeScript)
  - Shadcn UI for component styling
  - Zustand for state management
  - Liveblocks for real-time collaboration

- **Backend:**

  - Convex for real-time database functionality
  - Clerk for user authentication

- **Other Tools:**
  - ESLint and Prettier for code quality
  - Git for version control
  - Vercel for deployment

   ```

3. Set up environment variables:

   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory and add the following:

     ```env
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CLERK_FRONTEND_API=your_clerk_frontend_api
     CLERK_API_KEY=your_clerk_api_key
     NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=your_convex_url
     NEXT_PUBLIC_LIVEBLOCKS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_liveblocks_public_key
     ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- **User Authentication:** Sign up or log in using Clerk. Authentication is required to create and access boards.
- **Board Creation:** Create new boards, invite collaborators, and edit content in real-time with other users.
- **Real-Time Collaboration:** See live cursors, presence indicators, and updates as other users interact with the same board, all powered by Convex and Liveblocks.
- **Drag-and-Drop Elements:** Add, move, and modify elements on the board, with real-time sync for all participants.
