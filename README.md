## Overview

**Board** is a collaborative whiteboard web application, inspired by Miro, that allows users to create, edit, and interact with others in real time. Built using Next.js with TypeScript for the frontend, this project integrates a range of technologies to support real-time collaboration, user authentication, and state management. It utilizes Clerk for user authentication, Convex for a real-time database, Liveblocks for live presence and collaborative interactions, Shadcn UI for an elegant design system, and Zustand for global state management.

## Features

- **User Authentication**: User sign-up and login using Clerk.
- **Real-Time Collaboration**: Multiple users can interact on the same board simultaneously, using Liveblocks and Convex.
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Easily add and manipulate elements on the board.
- **State Management**: Global state management using Zustand.
- **Customizable Boards**: Create, update, and delete boards, with support for real-time updates.
- **Responsive UI**: Fully responsive design using Shadcn UI.
